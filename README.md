# Text Generation

## 1. Introduction
Text generation using deep learning has a wide range of applications in day to day life, such as converting text from one language to another, 
suggesting the next word while typing emails, checking grammatical mistakes and restructuring sentences, etc. 

## 2. Objective

In this project, we will take text from "Poirot Investigates" by Agatha Christie and train our model to generate some relevant text of specified length when some input text is provided.

## 3. Steps to execute this Project.
NOTE: Running the whole project might take extended period of time. Training time also depends on your systems computation capabilities.
1. Download/fork/clone the project by clicking [here](https://github.com/roshan-pandey/Text_generation) or just unzip the folder provided.
2. src/ directory contains the notebook with data prep and modeling code. Just upload that notebook to google colab and run it to start training the model. 
3. In case if you just want to see how the model is working, both LSTM and GRU models are provided in the models/ directory. 
Go to the "Testing Model" section of the notebook and run the cells under that section.


## 4. Reports
- Report is available in the reports/ directory.

## 5. Important Consideration
This project runs perfectly fine on Google colab by following the steps mentioned in section 3. If want to run on different OS, encoding might needs to be changed for text processing.
